# Math & CS Simulations

This project contains two short but powerful simulations written in Python.

---

## 📍 Project 1: Monte Carlo Simulation to Estimate Pi

A randomised simulation that estimates the value of π by plotting points inside a square and checking how many fall inside the inscribed circle.

- Inspired by probabilistic methods and randomness
- Built from scratch in Python with matplotlib
- Great example of how randomness can help solve mathematical problems

---

## 📍 Project 2: Conway’s Game of Life

A cellular automaton based on very simple rules — but it leads to complex, surprising behaviour over time.

- Implemented from scratch with matplotlib animations
- Visualises how order and patterns emerge from randomness
- Simulates ideas related to biology, AI, and complexity science

---

## 💻 Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming
- Loops, functions, randomisation
- Matplotlib for data visualisation and animation
- Logical thinking and pattern recognition

## 🏁 Output Samples

Below are some sample images from the simulations.

## 📈 Mandelbrot Set (Fractal Visualization)

This simulation generates the Mandelbrot Set — a famous fractal made from complex numbers — using Python and NumPy.

The result is a visual pattern with infinite detail. It's an example of how simple math can create complex beauty.
